    'MaInNo-intro': "愛遊戲的普通人，在Youtuber爆紅的時代開始接觸網絡，並以成為一名遊戲實況主為夢想，召集身邊的各路好友組成了娛樂團體‘心結廚房’。有傳聞指泡麵是整個廚房打遊戲最強的骨灰級玩家，在影格戰鬥中頗有修為。",

    'dobird-intro-2': "高端的食材往往需要樸素的料理方法。作為心結廚房的下鍋第一名，渡鳥極力讓自己成為瀕危物種以免遭殃，但面對台灣人感人的保育意識似乎並不起效，還是很愛有人喊讓她下鍋。至此，瀕危物種的反擊戰即將開打...",
    'honey-intro': "出身不明，來歷不明的擬態生物，以 ‘幽靈貓’自居生活在城市裡的神秘少女，為了賺外快加入了‘心結廚房’。基於自身散發出的不穩定磁場，每次直播時麥克風都總是很炸，因而成為直播中的個人特色。",
    'honey-intro-2': "熱愛TRPG，誓言要把骰子機器人娶回家。作為一隻幽靈貓，鬼點子特別多，然而是挖坑小能手，想到一出是一出，完美發揮出三分鐘熱度的本性，不愧是貓咪。",

    'karlos-intro-2':"自詡廚房中的為大家帶來歡樂的低能兒，卻比任何人都要努力的熱血騷年，目前在TRPG及RP區塊中相當活躍，也是一名老練的魔物獵人。",
    'skye-intro': "“蛤？廚房又有心結又有人受傷需要聊聊了喔？”“怎了，又有好看的RP劇情想要我漫畫化嗎？”接委託不問價錢，挖坑沒有半點猶豫的自由傭兵，沒有她做不到的，只要她想不到要做的！",
    'skye-intro-2': "活躍於廚房RP及角色創作區塊，將創作視為對平行世界的觀察，喜歡記錄角色的世界記錄員。不常在實況出現，卻總會告訴大家自己又收了哪款老遊戲的模擬器改版。",

    'miyar-intro': "可可愛愛的貓娘，廚房的萌系擔當，傳說只要拿起畫筆就能三天不睡覺的肝帝。擅長什麼都用手作，堪稱全廚房最強手作力，有著凡經過她手的都會變成萌系物件的魔法。",
    'miyar-intro-2': "因異世界旅行導致的後遺症，對於現實訊息的反應總是慢半拍。明明存在，但思路永遠在另一條世界線上，與眾人的時間流速差距過大，總被成員調侃說速度堪比IE。",

    'MaInNo-intro': "A regular gamer who grew up during the rise of YouTubers, he dreamed of becoming a game streamer. Along with his friends, he started an entertainment group: Knotchen. As an old-school player with serious skills, he enjoys having good fights in the games.",
    'MainNo-intro-2': "Though he's the strongest, he never tries to be the leader, which leaves the group in a fun and chaotic state. Still, thanks to MaInNo's warmth and care, everyone in Knotchen manages to get along.",
    'grass-intro': "A university engineer, and Knotchen's go-to techie—his schedule and sleep hours are a total mystery: you'll almost always see Grass online on Discord, 24/7. After being invited to join, he dove into another chapter of a grind-filled, work-hard kind of life.",
    'grass-intro-2': "Currently studying to become an AI engineer, he dreams of turning all humans into couch potatoes and automatising daily life. He loves bringing all sorts of weird inventions into Knotchen, often eventually causing explosive mishaps.",
    'dobird-intro': "Codenamed “Dobird,” she zips around the internet like a sneaky digital ninja. Loves parkour, doodling, and 3D modeling—basically anything to chill. While waiting to graduate, friends roped her into Knotchen, where she now fumbles her way through being a rookie game streamer.",
    'dobird-intro-2': "Fancy ingredients call for simple cooking. As Knotchen's first one in the pot, Dobird pretends to be endangered to stay safe—but people still love yelling for her to jump in. Looks like the endangered species' counterattack is about to begin…",
    'honey-intro': "A mysterious girl of unknown origins, calling herself “Somnium Terra.” Wandering the city, She joined Knotchen to earn some extra cash. Her unstable magnetic field makes every livestream's mic go haywire, which oddly became her signature quirk on stream.",
    'honey-intro-2': "Loves TRPGs and swears she'll marry a randomising robot that rolls dices someday. Inherently as a cat, she's full of wild ideas. Always improvising on the spot, she perfectly shows off her three-minute enthusiasm—classic cat behavior.",
    'zeroOne-intro':"(Disclaimer: to avoid looking like a random glitch, he prefers to be addressed as 'Zero1', but you can still call him '01'.) A regular worker in Taiwan with amazing fitness and the soul of a grandpa. MaInNo's college roommate, he joined Knotchen and now shines as both a DM and a streamer.",
    'zeroOne-intro-2':"Living by the “trailblaze” motto, he loves connecting with all kinds of people. As the member with the best health condition in Knotchen, he acts as the group's cheerleader, bringing extra warmth to everyone's life in Knotchen.",
    'karlos-intro':"Extra! Knotchen's got the Black Swordsman in the lore?! Dual-wielding knives for cooking, Carlos the chef makes a stylish entrance! An impulsive player with the catchphrase “faster, even faster,” he's sure to bring sparks and fun to Knotchen.",
    'karlos-intro-2':"Claims to be Knotchen's goof bringing everyone joy, but actually works harder than anyone else. This passionate young lad is super active in TRPG and RP groups and is also a seasoned monster hunter.",
    'skye-intro': "“Huh? Another Knotchen drama and someone needs to vent?” “What's up, another role-play story you'd like me to turn into a comic?” A freelance merc who takes commissions without asking the price and act on ideas without hesitation—there's nothing she can't do… as long as she can think of it first!",
    'skye-intro-2': "Active in Knotchen's role-play and character-creation sectors, she treats her work as observing parallel worlds, loving to record stories. She's not often on stream, but always updates everyone on which retro game emulator mod she's been tinkering with.",
    'jkiol-intro':  "The ultimate chaotic neutral of Knotchen, a cat-eared boy (?) from another dimension. Always popping up unexpectedly, he spices up life with all sorts of weird ideas. Nobody really knows why he joined, but no one could say no to this mischievous, fun-loving kitty.",
    'jkiol-intro-2': "Sometimes he joins Knotchen for parkour in assassin worlds, and during sieges he spins everyone around with flashy moves and lag tricks. But word is… he's got some other secrets too…?",
    'lucy-intro': "A demon girl from the underworld with hidden powers, she came to the human world seeking revenge for a loved one. Along the way, she accidentally fell in love with all kinds of board games and is now a master who knows them inside and out.",
    'lucy-intro-2': "Joined Knotchen to gather more info and stays active online with the rest of the crew. She sees herself as the group's caretaker and is really caring, but rumor has it she can get pretty scary when angry…?",
    'miyar-intro': "An adorable nekomata, Knotchen's cuteness support. Legend says once she picks up drawing, she can go three days straight without sleep. Skilled at making everything by hand, she's the group's ultimate crafting queen—anything that passes through her hands turns into a cute, magical creation.",
    'miyar-intro-2': "Suffers side effects from traveling between worlds, always a step slow on real-world info. Though present, her mind is always on another timeline, moving at a different pace than everyone else. The crew jokes that her speed is basically like IE.",
